# tictac
Tic-tac-toe game designed to freshen up my fluency with
Object Oriented Programming. Single-player and multi-player
modes, but beware, the CPU on the single-player mode is one
tough competitor. As usual, tic-tac-toe includes an X player
and an O player, both attempting to get three of their
letters in line, either on a row, a column, or diagonally
across the board.
